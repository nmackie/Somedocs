# Document in MardownD
This is a document written in **MarkdownD**.

## What this editor has
This editor has two panels. The left panel is in markdown. The right panel is the live preview. There is a tool bar. The tool bar allows users to click a button to apply the markdown format to the document.

There is an export to HTML and PDF option. This would make it eaiser for the Docs team to convert documents to the App or PDF should we want to go that route.

## What this editor does not have
- A clean look?
- Easy TOC support... not a huge deal though
- Does not seem to support docs made in other markdown apps.

## Cost
$15.00/instance

## HTML tests
<div style="color:red;"> HTML div tag used with color set to red.</div>
